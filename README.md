# IBM-Capestone-Project
IBM Data Analytics Profession Certification Capestone project

This project is the final capstone of the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where I applied end-to-end data analysis techniques to solve a real-world business problem. It demonstrates my ability to collect, clean, analyze, visualize, and present data-driven insights using industry-standard tools.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In this capstone, I worked with a real dataset to:
âœ… Define a problem statement based on business objectives
âœ… Extract and clean data for accuracy and consistency
âœ… Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns
âœ… Apply statistical techniques to support decision-making
âœ… Create data visualizations for better interpretation
âœ… Present actionable insights in a business-oriented report
